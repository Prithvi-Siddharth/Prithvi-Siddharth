# 👋 Hi there, I'm Prithvi Siddharth

I'm an aspiring **Data Scientist** with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. I enjoy solving complex problems using **Machine Learning**, **SQL**, **Databases**, and **Data Science** techniques. My goal is to build intelligent systems that can analyze patterns, predict outcomes, and drive impactful decisions.  

I love exploring new algorithms, experimenting with datasets, and creating end-to-end data solutions. I’m also keen on learning best practices in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Scalable ML Systems**. When I’m not coding, you can find me reading research papers, participating in Kaggle competitions,sharing knowledge with the data science community or watching adrenaline packed Formula 1 races.  

- 🔭 Currently exploring advanced machine learning models and working on personal projects.  
- 🌱 Always learning and experimenting with new data science tools and techniques.  
- 💬 Let’s collaborate on **data-driven projects** or discuss ideas in **AI & ML**!
